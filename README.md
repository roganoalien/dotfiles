The `.zshrc` file goes inside `./~` folder after `iterm2` and `ohmyzsh` are installed.

###### Theme
This file refers to `ZSH_THEME="agnoster"`theme which needs the file to be installed in the same `./~` folder.

###### Plugins
`zsh-iterm-touchbar` for the usage of ZSH funcionalities in the macos touchbar

###### Print some text when a neew window or tab is open
Needs the global installation of `fortune` and `cowsay` and the function is `fortune | cowsay -f stegosaurus`

###### Custom function to make directory and cd inside of it
The shortcut before the folder name is: `mkcd`

```shell
function mkcd(){
  mkdir $1 && cd $1
}
```

There are a lot of alias for tree functionality, cd to default repositories folder to run mongo, open file or folder in sublime text and connect to some servers.
